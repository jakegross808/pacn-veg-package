# Background

The Pacific Island Inventory and Monitoring Network (PACN) monitors five vegetation community types across the national parks of the pacific islands. Plant communities (restricted to locations within national park units) include the wet forest of Hawaiʻi and American Samoa, the subalpine shrubland of Hawaiʻi on the slopes of Mauna Loa and Haleakalā, the coastal strand of Hawaiʻi, the limestone forest on the island of Guam, and the mangrove forest on the island of Saipan (Table \@ref(tab:samp-frames-tbl)). Long-term, standardized monitoring protocols ([Ainsworth et al. 2011, 2012](#refs)) are implemented at repeated intervals (5-7 year cycles) to determine the status and trends of these plant communities.

# Methods

## Protocols (Vital Signs)

-   PACN’s primary vegetation monitoring protocol is titled [**Focal Terrestrial Plant Communities (FTPC)**](https://www.nps.gov/im/pacn/focal_communities.htm). This protocol utilizes 20m x 50m plots (except in coastal strand communities where plots are 10m x 20m). Native and non-native plant composition and structure are assessed in terms of vascular plant species diversity, understory cover, species density (of woody species by height or size class), and species distribution frequency. Additional measurements are collected on canopy height and coarse woody debris ([Ainsworth et al. 2011](#refs)).

-   In select locations, additional data regarding non-native plant species are collected via PACN’s [**Established Invasive Plant Species (EIPS)**](https://www.nps.gov/im/pacn/established_invasive.htm) protocol. This protocol utilizes 5m-wide transects divided into contiguous sub-plots (segments). Transect length is 1000m in the wet forest (except Kahuku in HAVO) and 500 m in the subalpine shrubland, while segments along the transects are 5m x 20m. At Coastal Strand, Mangrove Forest, and Kahuku-wet forest plant communities, transect length is variable (250m at Kahuku) and segments are 5m x 10m. Non-native species presence and estimates of cover are collected at each segment and summarized across each transect to provide data on non-native plant richness, frequency, and cover ([Ainsworth et al. 2012](#refs)).

All data utilized in this report are available for public use and can be downloaded using the NPS [DataStore](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/).

## Sample Size

Both vegetation monitoring protocols utilize a split panel design with two panels: (1) permanent sites (fixed) that are reread each sampling cycle and (2) temporary sites (rotational) that are visited only once. This study design assumes that the fixed sites provide greater ability to detect temporal changes, while the rotational sites greatly increase spatial coverage and help highlight spatial differences across the monitored area (and provide some temporal change detection over longer periods of time). In Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-map), fixed plots/transects are displayed as blue, while rotational plots/transects are displayed as red.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
sites <- PlotAndTransectLocations(sample_frame = params$sample_frame, protocol = var_protocol)

sites |>
  select()
```

**Map of `r samp_frame` monitoring sites**

```{r include=FALSE}
main_map_cap <- paste("All community plots (squares) and non-native transects (circle with line; if present in dataset) monitored within the", samp_frame, "-", community, "Plant Community. Fixed sites are blue. Rotational sites are red. The polygons represent the locations in which a rotational plot can be randomly placed - these 'sampling frames' are currectly labled by distinct 'Zones' if present within the dataset. If Zones are not present within the dataset, than the 'Location in Park' in Table 1 is used as the polygon lable. Mouse over the polygon to see the label. Click on the plot to see additional information about that plot. IF the plot is fixed, the most recent visit of that plot will appear on top.")
```

```{r sampling-map, out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE, fig.cap= paste(main_map_cap), message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
MapPACNVeg(sample_frame = params$sample_frame, protocol = var_protocol, cycle = params$cycle)
```

It should be noted that the number of fixed and rotational sites monitored depends upon the size and arrangement of the plant community within the park and, to some extent, the degree of difficulty accessing the sites. Financial and logistical challenges can result in reduced sample size during a monitoring cycle. Table \@ref(tab:samp-size-table) shows the total plots and transects monitored for each cycle for the `r sf_title` dataset.

## Vegetation Attributes

The results section of this report is organized by the vegetation attributes listed below. A quick overview of the methods used to collect the vegetation attributes is provided. If further details are needed, please see the protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for FTPC ([Ainsworth et al. 2011](#refs)) and EIPS ([Ainsworth et al. 2012](#refs) vital signs).

-   **Understory Cover:** Understory cover is sampled using the pole intercept method. The percent cover of a plant species is calculated by the frequency in which that species touches a vertical pole that is repeatedly positioned at specific points across the plot. Each plot contains 300 cover points. Two distinct height layers (strata) are recorded: 0-1 m from ground (Low) and 1-2 m from ground (High). Note that several visuals within this report combine these two strata into one 0-2 meter stratum in order to simplify the visual. Understory cover for individual plant species cannot be greater than 100%, however, any combined grouping of species (e.g. all shrubs, all native plants) are reported as total cover and can exceed 100% cover due to overlapping vegetation layers (multiple species touching the pole at a point).

-   **Plot Presence/Absence:** All vascular plant species rooted within the plot boundaries are recorded. Plot size is 20 x 50 m (with the exception of coastal strand plots, which are 10 x 20 m).

-   **\*Invasive Plant Transects (EIPS):** While both native and non-native plant data are collected within the FTPC plots, the EIPS invasive plant transects provide wider spatial coverage of non-native plant presence and abundance which can help managers strategize control efforts. Transects are made up of contiguous rectangular plots, referred to as segments to distinguish from FTPC, and within each segement all non-native species and their estimated cover class within the segment are recorded. \*Note that EIPS is not implemented at all locations (often due to steep terrain which prevents long linear traversal).

    -   *Non-native frequency -* Percentage of segments with presence of species, life forms, or other groupings.

    -   *Non-native cover class -* Percentage of segments with a particular cover class for a species.

    -   *Non-native richness* - Count of nonnative species per segment.

#### Potential Native Plant Declines

*Native plant species ranked by maximum cover decrease observed in a plot.*

-   Location of plot with steepest decrease should be examined further to understand cause and if similar declines are occurring elsewhere.

-   Species with declining trends in overall means should receive special attention.
