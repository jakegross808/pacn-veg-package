# Background

The Pacific Island Inventory and Monitoring Network (PACN) monitors five vegetation community types  across the national parks of the pacific islands. Plant communities (restricted to locations within national park units) include the wet forest of Hawaiʻi and American Samoa, the subalpine shrubland of Hawaiʻi on the slopes of Mauna Loa and Haleakalā, the coastal strand of Hawaiʻi, the limestone forest on the island of Guam, and the mangrove forest on the island of Saipan. Long-term, standardized monitoring protocols (Ainsworth et al. 2011, 2012) are implemented at repeated intervals (5-7 year cycles) to determine the status and trends of these plant communities.

## Protocols

-   PACN's primary vegetation monitoring protocol is titled **Focal Terrestrial Plant Communities (FTPC)**. This protocol utilizes 20m X 50m plots (except in coastal strand communities where plots are 10m X 20m). Native and non-native plant composition and structure are assessed in terms of vascular plant species diversity, understory cover, species density (of woody species by height or size class), and species distribution frequency. Additional measurements are collected on canopy height and coarse woody debris (Ainsworth et al. 2011). 

-   Additional data regarding non-native plant species are collected via PACN's **Established Invasive Plant Species (EIPS)** protocol. This protocol utilizes 5m-wide transects divided into contiguous sub-plots (segments). Transect length is 1000m in the wet forest (except Kahuku in HAVO) and 500 m in the subalpine shrubland, while segments along the transects are 5m x 20m. At Coastal Strand, Mangrove Forest, and Kahuku-wet forest plant communities, transect length is variable (250m at Kahuku) and segments are 5m x 10m. Non-native species presence and estimates of cover are collected at each segment and summarized across each transect to provide data on non-native plant richness, frequency, and cover (Ainsworth et al. 2012).

Both vegetation monitoring protocols utilize a split panel design with two panels: (1) permanent sites (fixed) that are reread each sampling cycle and (2) temporary sites (rotational) that are visited only once. This design allows for the use of fixed sites to detect temporal changes and rotational sites to assess status and increase spatial coverage over time. (fixed plots/transects are displayed as blue, while rotational plots/transects are displayed as red;  Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-map)).

## Study Site

Provide background information regarding the selected plant community type including location, elevation, rainfall, unique aspects, etc.

n_plots_rotational <- v_cover_bar_stats(sample_frame = params$sample_frame,
                       return_n = TRUE,

Monitoring sites per year:

Plots:

+ **Fixed:** `r n_plots_fixed`

+ **Rotational:** `r n_plots_rotational`

Transects:

+ **Fixed:** 
  
+ **Rotational:**


Understory Cover: Plant species understory cover was sampled within 50 x 20 m plots. Two height layers were recorded: 0-1 m from ground (Low) and 1-2 m from ground (High). Cover data was collected using the pole-intercept method (Ainsworth et al. 2011).

Invasive Plant Transects: Additional data on non-native plants were collected using frequency of occurrence along 500 m transects (Ainsworth et al. 2012).
