# Background

The Pacific Island Inventory and Monitoring Network (PACN) monitors subalpine shrubland plant communities occurring along the slopes of Haleakala and Mauna Loa in Hawaii. This brief focuses on the Haleakala section which includes 4460 ha and consists of generally vegetated sites above 1980 m encompassing Haleakala summit, the park visitor center, headquarters, and several hiking trails open to the public.

```{r sampling-map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Plots monitored within the Haleakala Subalpine Shrubland Plant Community.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
MapPACNVeg(sample_frame = "Haleakala")
```

# Methods

15 fixed plots and 15 fixed transects were monitored in 2012 and again in 2017 
(Figure \@ref(fig:sampling-map)).

-   Understory Cover: Plant species understory cover was sampled within 50 x 20 m plots. Two height layers were recorded: 0-1 m from ground (Low) and 1-2 m from ground (High). Cover data was collected using the pole-intercept method (Ainsworth et al. 2011).

-   Invasive Plant Transects: Additional data on non-native plants were collected using frequency of occurrence along 500 m transects (Ainsworth et al. 2012).


# Results

## Understory - Species Composition

-   The majority of plots contain greater native cover compared to non-native cover. However, note the exception of plot #3 (Figure \@ref(fig:tot-cover-graph)).

-   Plot #3 has the most non-native cover (144%) and only ~1% native cover (Table \@ref(tab:tot-cover-table)).

```{r tot-cover-composition, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Change in native vs. non-native cover. Point numbers corrspond to fixed monitoring sites.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
UnderNativityCover.plot.nat_v_non(cover.stat = "tot_pct_cov", 
                                  sample_frame = "Haleakala", 
                                  sample_cycle = 2, 
                                  paired_change = TRUE, 
                                  combine_strata = TRUE)
```

## Understory - Total Cover

-   The majority of plots contain greater native cover compared to non-native cover. However, note the exception of plot #3 (Figure \@ref(fig:tot-cover-graph)).

-   Plot #3 has the most non-native cover (144%) and only ~1% native cover (Table \@ref(tab:tot-cover-table)).

```{r tot-cover-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Native and non-native understory cover. Point numbers corrspond to fixed monitoring sites.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
UnderNativityCover.plot.nat_v_non(cover.stat = "tot_pct_cov", 
                                  sample_frame = "Haleakala", 
                                  sample_cycle = 2, 
                                  paired_change = TRUE, 
                                  combine_strata = TRUE)
```

```{r tot-cover-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cover_by_nativity <- UnderNativityCover(combine_strata = TRUE, 
                                        sample_frame = "Haleakala", 
                                        paired_change = FALSE) %>%
  filter(Cycle == 2) %>%
  filter(Nativity != "Unknown") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Plot_Number, Nativity, Total_Percent_Cover = tot_pct_cov) %>%
  arrange(-Total_Percent_Cover)
names(cover_by_nativity) <- gsub("_", " ", names(cover_by_nativity)) %>% str_to_title()  # Make column names nicer for display
cover_by_nativity %>%
  kbl(digits = 1, align = "c",
      caption = "Total understory cover per plot.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed")) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "300px") 
```

## Understory - Change in Cover

-   Most fixed plots showed increases in both native and non-native understory cover, with ratios favoring greater increases in non-native cover (Figure \@ref(fig:chg-cover-graph)).

-   Plot #2 showed the greatest increase in non-native percent cover (43), while Plot #10 showed the greatest decrease in native percent cover (-14.3) (Table \@ref(tab:chg-cover-table)).

```{r chg-cover-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Change in native vs. non-native cover. Point numbers corrspond to fixed monitoring sites.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
UnderNativityCover.plot.nat_v_non(cover.stat = "chg_per_cycle", 
                                  sample_frame = "Haleakala", 
                                  sample_cycle = 2, 
                                  paired_change = TRUE, 
                                  combine_strata = TRUE)
```

```{r chg-cover-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cover_by_nativity <- UnderNativityCover(combine_strata = TRUE, 
                                        sample_frame = "Haleakala", 
                                        paired_change = TRUE) %>%
  filter(Cycle == 2) %>%
  filter(Nativity != "Unknown") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Plot_Number, Nativity, Percent_Cover_Change = chg_per_cycle) %>%
  arrange(-Percent_Cover_Change)
names(cover_by_nativity) <- gsub("_", " ", names(cover_by_nativity)) %>% str_to_title()  # Make column names nicer for display
cover_by_nativity %>%
  kbl(digits = 1, align = "c",
      caption = "Change in understory cover per plot.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed")) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "300px") 
```
